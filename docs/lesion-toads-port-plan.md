# LesionTOADS and MaCRUISEplus port plan

**Status:** P39 is Started. P39a (numeric intensity initialization) and P39b
(atlas-prior parsing) are validated on synthetic/reference data. This document
tracks algorithm scope and source contracts; it does not claim a full
LesionTOADS port.

## Selected workflow and source

The selected contract is the MaSeg-informed `maCRUISEplus_v1` path. MATLAB
`maCRUISEpluspipeline.m` invokes `run_LesionToads_pipeline.m`, which invokes
`run_LesionToads_jist.m` and the selected
`edu.jhu.ece.iacl.plugins.classification.MedicAlgorithmLesionToads` adapter.
The numerical driver is `AlgorithmLesionToads`, with
`LesionToadPreprocess` and `LesionToadSegmentation`; atlas handling and
registration are in `DemonToadDeformableAtlas` and
`DemonsToadsAtlasWarping` under the supplied `toads-cruise/src` tree.

The selected `run_LesionToads_jist.m` settings are: T1 MPRAGE plus FLAIR,
lesion modeling enabled, correction disabled, output type `dura removal
inputs`, maximum iterations 99, smoothing 0.2, energy tolerance 1e-4, atlas
prior 2.0, distance limits 3/25/2, and connectivity `(18,6)`. The adapter
sets rigid atlas alignment, four levels, 50 initial alignment iterations,
one main registration iteration, demons smoothing 1.0/scale 2.0, identity
normalization, lesion weighting, and prior centroid mode with smoothness 0.1.
The wrapper labels for the distance limits do not map one-to-one to the
constructor field names; verify downstream semantics before final parameter
claims. The sibling `CRUISEpluspipeline.m` requests correction and `cruise
inputs`; it is not the selected profile.

The legacy plus preprocessing also includes skull-mask handling, EM, and dura
removal. The selected Python contract requires a user-provided binary brain
mask on the T1 grid and excludes BET, SPECTRE, and FreeSurfer. The mask is
normalized to RAS with a warning when needed and is shared by T1/FLAIR
preparation after grid checks. EM and dura-removal behavior that feeds
LesionTOADS still requires source tracing and validation; this input decision
does not claim parity with those excluded skull-stripping stages.

## Completed substeps

### P39a: intensity and centroid initialization

`src/pymacruise/lesion_toads_preprocessing.py` ports negative-value clamping,
per-channel robust bounds (fraction 0.01, two refinement scales), division by
the robust span without subtracting the minimum, and lesion/black-hole
centroids `low/span + atlas_prior`. On the committed 9×8×7 T1/FLAIR phantom,
all 1,008 normalized values, both channels' bounds, and both centroid vectors
match the standalone Java harness exactly. Zero robust spans are rejected;
the Java source instead propagates NaN/infinity. This is an explicit
invalid-input deviation. See
`tests/data/synthetic/lesion_toads_preprocessing/README.md`.

### P39b: descriptor prior parsing

`src/pymacruise/lesion_atlas_priors.py` reads structure order, modality
intensity rows, lesion priors, and black-hole priors without loading image
arrays. A small image-free descriptor fixture checks ordering and malformed
inputs. The bundled `cruise-atlas-12obj-lesiontoads2012.txt` structure order
and selected T1 MPRAGE/FLAIR values match the source descriptor; lesion priors
are `[0.4, 1.2]` and black-hole priors `[0.1, 0.6]`. Missing selected profiles
are rejected instead of using the source's zero/label fallback.

## Next source-faithful increments

1. Port lesion atlas topology/shape loading and transformed-prior sampling;
   preserve descriptor order and use the bundled `.nii.gz` assets in the
   legacy Java index order. Do not introduce any external atlas directory
   dependency.
2. Resolve and bundle the selected 18/6 critical-point lookup table as a
   regular Git file if the source algorithm needs it. It is absent from the
   selected `toads-cruise` source/atlas folders but present in the supplied
   VandyCRUISE source tree; record provenance and a checksum before use.
3. Port preprocessing, atlas alignment, lesion and black-hole membership
   initialization, relation/boundary maps, and the iterative
   topology-preserving competition/propagation stages in small observable
   increments. Reuse the validated intensity and descriptor helpers where
   their source contracts match.
4. Port the selected output products and the plus-specific preparation
   around the shared user brain mask, T1/FLAIR N4, EM, and dura stages.
5. Build a larger folded synthetic lesion phantom with a narrow sulcus,
   attached dura, and known lesion inclusion. Compare intermediate and final
   maps against the selected Java implementation; require per-label Dice
   ≥0.97 and record all surface/geometry limits when those outputs become
   available.
6. Assemble synthetic plus workflow outputs only after the base TOADS and
   required preparation stages can run independently. Keep actual MRI behind
   the synthetic readiness gate.

The selected algorithm is a separate LesionTOADS engine, so its preprocessing
and descriptor work can proceed while base P18 is incomplete. Full
MaCRUISEplus assembly remains dependent on shared input preparation and
verified tissue/dura products.
